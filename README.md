Triangulated Human Observation for Reasoning in the Natural Sciences

## what this model aims to be

We are trying to build a decentralized, peer-to-peer, always online, always learning LLM - with Hivemind integrated into the model itself. We will do this via a mixture of experts, sparse routing, and by replacing feedforward layers with remote experts.

## install

The model: `pip install .`

Everything: `pip install .[all]`
